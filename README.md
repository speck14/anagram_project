Determines if two strings are anagrams of one another

##Problem:
An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase irrespective of spaces. For example, "orchestra" and "carthorse." Another example is "rail safety" and "fairy tales." Given two words or phrases, determine if they're anagrams of each other.
